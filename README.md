# PEXT Installer
## Introduction
PEXT stands for **p**ear **ext**ension file. It is nothing more than a fancy shell script. 
A PEXT file is used by the [update manager](https://github.com/alxb421/update-mgr) to update a pearOS PC.

## Languages:
Python was used for the backend( thanks to [axtlos](https://github.com/axtloss)
Glade was used for the frontend(nice UI :)  )
